- Loan Classification: Categorization of loans into 'good' and 'bad' loans, helping to identify patterns in repayment behavior and risk assessment.

- Interest Rate Trends: Examination of prevailing interest rates across various loan categories over time, providing insights into the financial market's dynamics.

- Loan Amount Distribution: Analysis of the distribution of funded amounts, highlighting trends in lending practices and borrower demands.

- Debt-to-Income Analysis: Exploration of debt-to-income ratios to evaluate borrowers' financial health and repayment capacity.
